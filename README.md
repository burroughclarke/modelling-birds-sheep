# modelling-birds-sheep

Current progress:

Question 1: seems to working fine
– add plots that produce data for the report

Question 2: sheep are divided into three areas
– fix the y axis problem of sheep going from top to bottom of screen
– split sheep into 'farmer A' and 'farmer B' flocks
– plot 'farmer A's sheep' vs 'farmer B's sheep'
